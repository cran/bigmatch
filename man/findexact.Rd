\title{Build an exact match variable given a matrix of covarites ordered by the user according to their importance.}
\usage{
findexact(z,E,ncontrol=1)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{ A vector whose ith coordinate is 1 for a treated unit and is 0 for a control.}
\item{E}{ A matrix or a vector with length(z) rows giving the covariates that need to be exactly matched.}
\item{ncontrol}{ The number of controls to be matched to each treated individual.}
}
\value{
\item{miss}{The covariates that cannot be exactly matched.}
\item{variables}{The covariates that can be exactly matched.}
\item{NewExact}{The constructed exact match variable.}
}
\description{
The function is used to build an exact match variable given a matrix of covarites ordered by the user according to their importance. It will select as many important covariates as possible.
