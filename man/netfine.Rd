\usage{
netfine(z, fine, dist, ncontrol=1, penalty=1000, max.cost=penalty/10,
nearexPenalty=max.cost, sub=F, subX=NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{ A vector whose ith coordinate is 1 for a treated unit and is 0 for
a control. }
\item{fine}{ A vector of with length(z)=length(fine) giving the nominal levels
that are to be nearly-finely balanced.}
\item{dist}{ A distance list with the starting node (treated subjec), ending
node (control), the distance between them and whether nearexact is needed for each pair.}
\item{ncontrol}{ A positive integer giving the number of controls to be
matched to each treated subject.}
\item{penalty}{ A numeric penalty imposed for each violation of fine balance.}
\item{max.cost}{ The maximum cost for the each pair of treated and control
while rounding the cost. }
\item{nearexPenalty}{ The penalty for a mismatch on nearexact. If it is a number, then use the same
penalty for all nearexact variables. Otherwise, it should be a vector of length the same as number
of nearexact variables, indicating the penalty for mismatch on each nearexact variable.}
\item{sub}{ An indicator of whether optimal subset matching is required.}
\item{subX}{ If a subset matching is required, the variable that the subset matching is based on, i.e. only minimum of number of treated and controls will be matched.}
}
\value{ A network for optimal near-fine matching.}
\description{
The function creates the network for optimal near-fine matching to be passed
via callrelax to the Fortran code for Bertsekas and Tseng's (1988) Relax IV.
Of limited interest to most users; function netfine() would typically be called by some other functions.
}
\details{

The network contains a bipartite graph for treated and control subjects plus
additional nodes for fine balance categories, plus additional nodes accept
needed deviations from fine balance yielding near-fine balance.

For discussion of fine-balance, see Rosenbaum (1989, Section 3) and Rosenbaum (2010).
For near-fine balance balance, see Yang et al. (2012).
