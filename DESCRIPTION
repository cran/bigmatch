Title: Making Optimal Matching Size-Scalable Using Optimal Calipers
Version: 0.6.4
Author: Ruoqi Yu
Maintainer: Ruoqi Yu <ruoqiyu125@gmail.com>
Description: Implements optimal matching with near-fine balance in large observational studies with the use of optimal calipers to get a sparse network. The caliper is optimal in the sense that it is as small as possible such that a matching exists. The main functions in the 'bigmatch' package are optcal() to find the optimal caliper, optconstant() to find the optimal number of nearest neighbors, and nfmatch() to find a near-fine balance match with a caliper and a restriction on the number of nearest neighbors.
